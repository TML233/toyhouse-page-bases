## Bases
Click into folders to see each of the page bases.

## Use a CSS inliner
All of the CSS styles in my code are not inlined.
Use a CSS inliner([e.g.](https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/)) to inline CSS styles into HTML tags to use them on Toyhouse.

**IMPORTANT: Remove the first 3 lines of `<link>` tags, as they are already referenced on Toyhouse.**
